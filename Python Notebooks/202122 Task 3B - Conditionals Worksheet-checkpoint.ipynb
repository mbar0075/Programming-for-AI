    "\n",
    "Let's walk through the main differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "Python gets rid of () and {} by incorporating two main factors: a *colon* and *whitespace*. The statement is ended with a colon, and whitespace is used (indentation) to describe what takes place in case of the statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another major difference is the lack of semicolons in Python. Semicolons are used to denote statement endings in many other languages, but in Python, the end of a line is the same as the end of a statement.\n",

    "## Indentation\n",

    "# CONDITIONALS\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to write useful programs, we almost always need the ability to check conditions\n",
    "and change the behavior of the program accordingly. Conditional statements give us this\n",
    "ability. The simplest form is the <code>if</code> statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python \n",
    "    if x > 0:\n",
    "        print('x is positive')\n",
    "```\n",
    "The boolean expression after <code>if</code> is called the **condition**. If it is true, the indented statement runs. If not, nothing happens.\n",
    "\n",
    "<code>if</code> statements have the same structure as function definitions: a header followed by an\n",
    "indented body. Statements like this are called compound statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no limit on the number of statements that can appear in the body, but there has to\n",
    "be at least one. Occasionally, it is useful to have a body with no statements (usually as a\n",
    "place keeper for code you havenâ€™t written yet). In that case, you can use the pass statement,\n",
    "which does nothing.\n",
    "```python \n",
    "    if x < 0:\n",
    "        pass # TODO: need to handle negative values!\n",
