                          Zebbug, whose name means olives in Maltese in reference to the large olive groves that once grew
there. It is one of the oldest towns in Malta, born out of the merger of three communities that
developed during the Arab occupation (870 - 1090), namely Hal Dwin, Hal Muxi and Hal Mula.<br><br>
Zebbug was as important as both Mdina and Valletta during the time of the Knights of St John, so
much so that Grand Master Emmanuel de Rohan-Polduc elevated it to the status of a city, and
granted it the grand title of Citta Rohan in 1777. In gratitude, the residents promised to build two
triumphal arches in de Rohan’s honour. However, due to technical difficulties, only half the promise
was maintained, and only one arch was constructed at a cost of 1,000 scudi funded entirely by the
residents and the parish church. Sadly, de Rohan did not live to see his arch completed, but it still
stands proudly today, marking the entrance to the town’s historic centre. <br><br>
During the time of the Order of St. John, Ħaż-Żebbuġ became one of the most important towns on
the island, mainly due to its major role in the cotton industry, and also because of the presence of a
number of prominent corsairs who lived there.

                      Ħaz-Żebbuġ has also produced a national poet in Dun Karm Psaila. Born into a working-class family in
                      1871, he excelled at school from an early age, eventually studying at the Seminary in order to fulfil
                      his wish of becoming a priest. He then proceeded to study philosophy and theology at the University
                      of Malta, before being ordained in 1894. In the following years, he himself taught various subjects at
                      the Seminary: from languages to arithmetic, geography and cosmography. In 1921 he was appointed
                      assistant librarian at the National Library of Malta, and in 1923 director of circulating libraries, a post
                      he held till his retirement in 1936.<br><br>
                      Before 1912 Dun Karm wrote only in Italian but eventually started to write poetry in Maltese. In
                      recognition of his contribution to Maltese literature, he received several honours and awards. He is
                      best known as the author of numerous religious hymns in Maltese, but especially for writing the
                      words to the Maltese National Anthem, which was sung for the first time in 1923.<br><br>
                      Dun Karm was also declared as Malta’s national poet in recognition of the numerous works in the
                      Maltese language. He passed away in 1961, just five days short of his 90 th  birthday. His funeral was
                      held at the parish church of Ħaż-Żebbuġ, and he was buried in a chapel built specifically for him in
                      the local cemetery.<br><br>

                    <img class="img-fluid2"  title="Dun Mikiel Xerri" src="https://cdn.newsbook.com.mt/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/16162451/mikiel.jpg" style="width:100%;height:10%;" alt="..." />

                      The Maltese patriot Dun Mikiel Xerri lived under both the Knights of St. John and later the French
                      when they took over the Maltese Islands in June 1798. Originally born and baptised in Ħaż-Żebbuġ in
                      1737, Dun Mikiel, studied philosophy in Italy, and later became a university professor back in Malta,
                      as well as being ordained a priest. By the time of the Maltese uprising against the French on
                      2 nd  September 1798, Dun Mikiel was living in Valletta, where together with thousands of other
                      inhabitants, he became trapped during the ensuing siege.<br><br>
                       
                      In the months that followed, as Maltese rebels sought to starve out the French garrison from the
                      fortified harbour cities, hundreds of people were dying from starvation and deprivation. A group of
                      patriots from within the fortifications resolved to risk their lives, in an attempt to break the
                      deadlock. The group, with Dun Mikiel as one of the leaders, intended to open the gates of the
                      fortified cities, so that they could be rushed by the rebels waiting outside. Unfortunately, the French
                      discovered the plot, and 49 people, Dun Mikiel among them, were soon rounded up.<br><br>
                      On the morning of 17 th  January 1799, the archbishop of Malta, Vincenzo Labini, visited Xerri and his
                      companions at Fort St. Elmo, where they were being held. Afterwards, the prisoners were led to St.
                      George’s Square where a firing squad awaited. Dun Mikiel did his best to lift the spirits of the
                      condemned men through prayer. When it was time, he gave a silver watch to the officer in charge
                      and asked to be shot in the heart. His last deed before he met his faith, was to shout &quot;May God have
                      pity on us! Long live Malta!&quot; After the initial volley of fire, those still clinging to life were hastily
                      despatched. Dun Mikiel Xerri was 61 years old.<br><br>

                    <img class="img-fluid2"  title="Mikiel Anton Vassalli" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cc/Malta_-_Zebbug_-_Triq_l-Imdina_-_Mikiel_Anton_Vassalli_01_ies.jpg/1200px-Malta_-_Zebbug_-_Triq_l-Imdina_-_Mikiel_Anton_Vassalli_01_ies.jpg" style="width:100;height:100;" alt="..." />
                    <p class="text-white-50"style="color:brown;"><br><br>
                      Mikiel Anton Vassalli, known as the father of the Maltese language, was a writer, philosopher
                      and linguist. Born into a poor family in Ħaz-Żebbuġ in 1764, he lost his father when he was only two
                      years old. From childhood, he demonstrated a talent for languages, and at the age of 21, he moved
                      to a university in Rome, where he studied oriental languages, soon becoming a professor in the field.
                      It was at this time that he published several important books on the Maltese language, becoming the
                      first person to study it scientifically and according to its Semitic roots.<br><br>
                      In truth, Vassalli&#39;s primary aim was not the Maltese language in itself, but the education of the
                      Maltese people, which he believed could only be attained through their native tongue. He believed
                      that if they could learn to read and write in Maltese, they could then use it to learn other languages
                      and therefore keep in touch with what was happening outside our shores. He believed that
                      successive foreign rulers wanted to discourage the Maltese from learning their own language so that
                      they would remain ignorant and could then be easily exploited.<br><br>
                      From Italy, Vassalli returned to Malta, to what was to be one of the most turbulent periods of
                      Maltese history, consisting of the final years of the Knights of St. John, the two-year French period,
                      and the first years of British rule. This was also a time of great upheaval throughout the continent,
                      which would come to a head with the French Revolution. Vassalli closely followed the developments
                      that were taking place and considered how certain ideas could be implemented here. Needless to
                      say, this did not endear him to the Knights, and after the discovery of his involvement in a political
                      plot, he was sentenced to life imprisonment, although he was soon released following the French
                      takeover.<br><br>
                      This chapter of Malta’s history was of course very short-lived, and his association with the French
                      authorities led to British accusations that he was a francophile, which led to him being exiled to
                      France. He returned to Malta 20 years later, aged 56, poor, and in bad health. Soon after he started

                      to teach at the University of Malta as the first Professor of the Maltese language while continuing to
                      write important works.<br><br>
