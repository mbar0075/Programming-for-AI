It's absolutely stunning inside. How a small Maltese village has such a spectacular church is amazing.A few locals were sat inside and there was always people coming and going from it during the day.Worth a visit if you are in the village."}{"Name": "Orland0_11", "Date": "17/12/2021 - 13:54:2", "Review": "The church of St. Philip of Agira dominates the Zebbug skyline. It's a must visit if you plan to come to Zebbug. There are many small bars and shops surrounding the church. The church is truly majestic."}{"Name": " josephx528", "Date": "17/12/2021 - 13:57:47", "Review": "Magnificent church in the centre of one of Malta 2019s oldest villages.
